FOR NOW CODING STYLE GUIDE IS AS FOLLOWS:

FRONT-END
The type of components that will be used in this project are function based components and not class based ones.
Naming the file of a react component should begin with a capital letter for example, if your component is called perosn the name of the file will be Person.js

BACK-END
1. Model names should not include space or _, -, intead use Capital Letters eg. (CareerHistory

2. Model fields/ attr should begin with Capital Letter and Abbreviated where possible eg. (Fname instead ofFirst Name or RNumber instead of RegimentNumber)
   If more than one word is in the name follow rule 1. eg. (TinNumber)
3. If a new project is created use version number, this is version 1, hence, GDF-HRMS-v1 next would be GDF-HRMS-v1.1
4. Any naming of classes/ methods should follow rule 1.
